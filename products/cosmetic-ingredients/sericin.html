                            Sericin is mainly refined form of silk fibre. Seidecosa Sericin is the first ever to succeed using a unique and advanced technology of extraction and refining sericin. We are providing a wide range of products which are mainly used as valuable active ingredient in cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry.<br>
                            18 kinds of Amino Acids can be found in sericin. Serine and aspartate have the highest content in Sericin. Besides, it also has the other amino acids necessary to human body. Because in sericin, about 80% amino acid has hydrophilic lateral group, about 1/3 of which is serine which water absorption is 50 times high than that of glycerin. Sericin, as the raw material of cosmetic, has excellent moisture absorption and preservative ability. Sericin protein forms a film on the surface of skin and hair so the water in skin can be preserved, and it can protect skin cutin from any kind of roughness. It nourishes the skin can be and the hair can be which become soft and flexible, and it also benefits for the shaping of hair. Meanwhite, it does not adhere to hair. <br><br>
                            Sericin is excellent in moisture preservation due to amino acid serine,which is one of the most important amino acids among the NMF. It is also effective in controlling the occurrence of active oxygen, As it is gentle on the skin and is an excellent moisturizer, protector and whitening, it is attracting attention as a skin care ingredient. <br><br>

                                </b><br> Sericin has an amino acid structure similar to NMF (natural moisturizing factor) which is naturally part of our human makeup. Among these is "serine," an important moisturizing acid which has a high consistency in sericin, providing a moistening element. Furthermore, purified pure sericin is having the same amount of moisture and smoothness found in silk.

Among these is "serine," an important moisturizing acid which has a high consistency in sericin, providing a moistening element. Furthermore, purified pure sericin is having the the same amount of moisture and smoothness found in silk.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Gentle on the skin</b><br>  It is as smooth as silk and does not stick to skin. Yet even after repeated washing, its effect remains almost the same. It gives a gentle, soft silky touch.
