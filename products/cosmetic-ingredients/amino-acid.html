                            Silk amino acids have a lower molecular weight than hydrolyzed silk protein powders as they undergo a greater degree of hydrolysis. Due to their smaller molecular weight they are more penetrating and moisturizing to skin and hair.

                            <ul>
                                <li>1. The composition of silk extract is well refined through biological process to get Seidecosa Amino Acid, more than 85% of whose content are alanine, serine and glycin, is a functionally prominent nutrient with higher nutritional valuevery and easy to be permeated to the derma layer of skin and to be absorbed by skin, so as to meet the effectiveness of skin-nurturing.</li>
                                <li>2. The silk extract have the better nourishing function for the hair injured either by mechanism or chemicals, which can permeate to the interior of injured hair to repair or protect it.</li>
                                <li>3. Seidecosa amino acid have a good dissolvability with anionic, cationic, nonionic or amphoteric surfactants or multi-kinds of oily materials, as well as a good compatibility in the formula of cream or shampoo etc.Due to its action in the enzyme metabolism, Seidecosa amino acid can keep and adjust moisture, prevent skin from ultraviolet radiation, restrain splash generation, facilitate anti-aging for skin.</li>
                                <li>4. Among the multi-kinds amino acid contained in Seidecosa amino acid, the content of glycine is the highest. Not only can it be used as the essential materials of synthesizing protein in the internal of organism, but also as the precuror of synthesizing the glutathione (GSH, GSSG), purine and heme, which the GSM plays a certain preventive function for angiocardiopathy, carcinosis & human senility. Meanwhile, the glycine also has the function of detoxication for some aromatics which can cause cancer to human body. The rich alanine in the silk extract has the functions of promoting the metabolism of alcohol in human body to protect the liver, and of reducing the blood sugar, therefore, it also is accepted for the products of dispelling the effects of alcohol. This property of Seidecosa amino acidhave the wide application field in the development of healthy foodstuff.

									<ol>
										<li>&#8226; The Sericin powder has better effect in anti-oxidation than VC and it removes the side-effect caused by free radical.
										<ol>
											<li>1. Edible antioxidant used in greasy food.</li>
											<li>2. Used as Antioxidant in cosmetics.</li>
										</ol> 
										</li><br>		
										<li>&#8226; The protein contained in Sericin is similar to that in human skin. So effectively it can combine with upper-cell through cetin and helpful to provide skin and hair basic nutrients and damnification is restored.
											<ol>
											<li>1. Tonics rich in amino acid.</li>
											<li>2. Safeguard skin and erase wrinkles.</li>
										</ol> 
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; Sericin powder has function in preserving and maintaining moisture.Seidecosa sericin has advantages in penetrating and maintaining moisture and avoid dryness, wrinkles hair protection and it also has antiaging property.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; Sericin is a good anti-oxidation and can restrain the activity of polyhphenol oxidase (PPO) in food especially for rich grease food, cream and milk products.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; As Sericin has skin caring, anti-microbe, and comfort effects it is used in fiber coating, such as under-dress, bed sheet and leather.
										</li>

                        <!-- <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Usage</h3>
									<ol>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Excellent absorbtion capability with moisture release</b><br>  Sericin is smooth and gentle on the skin. Fraichir gives wearers a silk-like fresh comfortable feeling by reducing the uncomfortableness of being sweaty and wet.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Skin Nourishment</b><br>Sericin has an amino acid structure similar to NMF (natural moisturizing factor) which is naturally part of our human makeup. Among these is "serine," an important moisturizing acid which has a high consistency in sericin, providing a moistening element. Furthermore, purified pure sericin is having the the same amount of moisture and smoothness found in silk.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Gentle on the skin</b><br>  It is as smooth as silk and does not stick to skin. Yet even after repeated washing, its effect remains almost the same. It gives a gentle, soft silky touch.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Skin Care Functional Material</b><br>  A skin care material produced from pure sericin, less irritant and gentle on delicate skin.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Less irritant</b><br>  Seidecosa sericin is soft and gentle on skin, covered with protein. This protein is further purified and used to coat every yarn. A veil of pure sericin softens any irritant touch and protects delicate skin. Even after repeated washing, its effect remains almost the same. It has been verified as safe by a medical specialist.
