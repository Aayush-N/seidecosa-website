						<p id="product_desc">
							Feed Grade Rice protein is the dried residue from rice after the removal of
							starch and separation of the bran by the process employed in the wet
							milling manufacture of rice starch or syrup or glucose. This rice protein
							meal's colour is bright and yellow, it is usually used as poultry feed
							because it contains an above average amino acid profile, added
							vitamins and high protein content and it can help poultry to increase
							their anti-virus activity, development activity and food calling activity.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our product is made with non gmo rice and an excellent option for animal feeds for reducing ration cost, replacing portions of expensive soybean meal and di-calcium phosphate and hence reducing the feed cost for farmers and feed manufacturers.

										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; Sericin powder has function in preserving and maintaining moisture.Seidecosa sericin has advantages in penetrating and maintaining moisture and avoid dryness, wrinkles hair protection and it also has antiaging property.

										<li>&#8226; Sericin is a good anti-oxidation and can restrain the activity of polyhphenol oxidase (PPO) in food especially for rich grease food, cream and milk products.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; As Sericin has skin caring, anti-microbe, and comfort effects it is used in fiber coating, such as under-dress, bed sheet and leather.

										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Skin Nourishment</b><br>Sericin has an amino acid structure similar to NMF (natural moisturizing factor) which is naturally part of our human makeup. Among these is "serine," an important moisturizing acid which has a high consistency in sericin, providing a moistening element. Furthermore, purified pure sericin is having the the same amount of moisture and smoothness found in silk.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Gentle on the skin</b><br>  It is as smooth as silk and does not stick to skin. Yet even after repeated washing, its effect remains almost the same. It gives a gentle, soft silky touch.
