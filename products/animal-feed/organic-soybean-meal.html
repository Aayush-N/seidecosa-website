											Soybean meal is the dominant protein supplement used in livestock,
											aqua, poultry diets and is the standard to which alternative protein
											sources are compared. It is widely used as a filler and source of protein
											in animal diet including pig, chicken, cattle, horse, sheep, and fish feed.
										</p>
										<p>
											Soybean meal is the by-product of the extraction of soybean oil. The oil
											may be removed by solvent extraction or by an expeller process in
											which the beans are heated and squeezed. Most commercial feeds use
											solvent-extracted soybean meal. Only mechanically extracted soybean
											meal can be used in organic poultry diets.
										</p>
										<p>
											Soybean meal is by far the world's most widely used oilseed meal and
											protein concentrate in livestock, aqua, poultry feeds. Its popularity is
											based on its low price, its high protein quantity and quality (its amino
											acids are an excellent source of protein for feed industry) and its good
											availability.

										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Skin Nourishment</b><br>Sericin has an amino acid structure similar to NMF (natural moisturizing factor) which is naturally part of our human makeup. Among these is "serine," an important moisturizing acid which has a high consistency in sericin, providing a moistening element. Furthermore, purified pure sericin is having the the same amount of moisture and smoothness found in silk.
										</li><br>
										<li>&#8226; <b>Gentle on the skin</b><br>  It is as smooth as silk and does not stick to skin. Yet even after repeated washing, its effect remains almost the same. It gives a gentle, soft silky touch.
